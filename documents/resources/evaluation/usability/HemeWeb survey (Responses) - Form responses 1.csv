For real practical applications, this does not seem to do more than staging files and submitting a job to the queueing system. For experienced people this is fairly easy to do on the command line, and I doubt that less experienced people would be able to make reasonable choices of parameters etc. When it comes to debugging, the additional abstraction layer probably makes things more complicated.

Nice separation of stdout/stderr on the output (again avoiding two seperate log files as you potentially need on command line).
