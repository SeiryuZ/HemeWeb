\chapter[Introduction]{Introduction}
Software are increasingly complex. Our everyday software are crammed with features that makes its usage difficult. To people without familiarity with the product, it will be a barrier of entry to use it even when it is really good for them.

This also ties in to the complexity of the research. Many of this softwares are developed as part of researches. Open science dictates that research should be reproducible or replicable for it to better validate the research. However, recent findings have shown that not many research in psychology or even computation are replicable easily.  


\section{Motivation}
To study how blood flow in a given vessel, a fluid dynamic simulation software named HemeLB was originally developed by \cite{mazzeo2008hemelb}. Currently, it is actively developed and used by researchers to help their study. For example, \cite{itani2015automated} used HemeLB for automated ensemble simulation of blood flow for a range of exercise intensities,  \cite{bernabeu2015characterization} used it for detecting difference of retinal hemodynamics with regards to diabetic retinopathy, and recently \cite{franco2015dynamic,franco2016non} used it to understand branching pattern of blood vessel networks.

\section{Objectives}


\section{Outline}
I provide a brief introduction to the topic of this dissertation in this chapter. The rest of the chapters will be organized as follow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chapter 2}. I will provide background information that are necessary for readers to understand the concepts, technology and implementation that are done in this dissertation. HemeLB, containerization technology, cloud computing, High-Performance computing infrastructure, and other topics will be discussed in details in this chapter.
    \item \textbf{Chapter 3}. I will discuss the bulk of the work in this chapter. Implementation details and design of the proposed solutions will be provided and discussed in details.
    \item \textbf{Chapter 4}. Evaluation
    \item \textbf{Chapter 5}. Analysis
    \item \textbf{Chapter 6}. Future work
\end{itemize}
