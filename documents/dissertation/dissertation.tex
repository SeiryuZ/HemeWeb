%% Sample use of the infthesis class to prepare a thesis. This can be used as 
%% a template to produce your own thesis.
%%
%% The title, abstract and so on are taken from Martin Reddy's 	 class
%% documentation.

%% MEF, October 2002
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%
%% Load the class. Put any options that you want here (see the documentation
%% for the list of options). The following are samples for each type of
%% thesis:
%%
%% Note: you can also specify any of the following options:
%%  logo: put a University of Edinburgh logo onto the title page
%%  frontabs: put the abstract onto the title page
%%  deptreport: produce a title page that fits into a Computer Science
%%      departmental cover [not sure if this actually works]
%%  singlespacing, fullspacing, doublespacing: choose line spacing
%%  oneside, twoside: specify a one-sided or two-sided thesis
%%  10pt, 11pt, 12pt: choose a font size
%%  centrechapter, leftchapter, rightchapter: alignment of chapter headings
%%  sansheadings, normalheadings: headings and captions in sans-serif
%%      (default) or in the same font as the rest of the thesis
%%  [no]listsintoc: put list of figures/tables in table of contents (default:
%%      not)
%%  romanprepages, plainprepages: number the preliminary pages with Roman
%%      numerals (default) or consecutively with the rest of the thesis
%%  parskip: don't indent paragraphs, put a blank line between instead
%%  abbrevs: define a list of useful abbreviations (see documentation)
%%  draft: produce a single-spaced, double-sided thesis with narrow margins
%%
%% For a PhD thesis -- you must also specify a research institute:
%\documentclass[phd,ilcc,twoside]{infthesis}

%% For an MPhil thesis -- also needs an institute
% \documentclass[mphil,ianc]{infthesis}

%% MSc by Research, which also needs an institute
% \documentclass[mscres,irr]{infthesis}

%% Taught MSc -- specify a particular degree instead. If none is specified,
%% "MSc in Informatics" is used.
% \documentclass[msc,cogsci]{infthesis}
\documentclass[msc,logo]{infthesis}  % for the MSc in Informatics

%% Master of Informatics (5 year degree)
% \documentclass[minf]{infthesis}

%% Undergraduate project -- specify the degree course and project type
%% separately
% \documentclass[bsc]{infthesis}
% \course{Artificial Intelligence and Psychology}
% \project{Fourth Year Project Report}

\maketitle

\begin{pabstract}

In this dissertation, we developed HemeWeb, an alternative interface to HemeLB, a complex computational fluid dynamic tools. This web application is developed to enable domain experts to use HemeLB simulation software without worrying about configurations of the software and the simulation. To measure the system, we run a usability evaluation and a performance benchmark. On the usability evaluation, respondents have to run a HemeLB simulation and reproduce past simulation, in which after both scenario, they will be asked to answer some questions. Respondents generally find the system subjectively satisfying to use and usable in doing the tasks given. On the performance benchmark, we compare the performance  of HemeLB simulation on HemeWeb using cloud platforms compared to dedicated HPC infrastructure. We found out that HemeWeb perform worst and costs more while offering more flexibility in running the simulation.
