To better support HemeLB simulation workflow, HemeWeb can be further improved. I suggest the followings area to be further developed in the future:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Handle geometry generation step of HemeLB simulation workflow
	
	There are some steps which are not included in this project due to time constraints. One of them is the profile generation step. In this step, the domain experts should generate a profile file by pointing out how the simulation will run. They need to point where the blood will flow into the 3D  model of the vascular system, where it will flow out, the blood viscosity, and other various parameters that will affect the simulation result. This process will most likely require a graphical user interface for the domain experts to interact with.
	
	\item Viewing simulation result on the browser.
	
	HemeLB simulation outputs are  in a format that is viewable by a third party tool, ParaView. It will be ideal if HemeWeb can be one stop solution for HemeLB simulation that domain experts do not have to bother with all other tools to view the output of it. A ParaView integration can be done in the next step of the development so that simulation result can be directly viewed on the browser so users do not have to bother with an extra tool to configure and install.
	
	\item HemeLB simulation security
	
	As outlined in the implementation challenge of the project, security was not the main focus of this project. However, if this project is to be an essential part of the future medical decision, security will need to be addressed seriously. After all, the patient's private health information will be used for the simulation. A system using such highly private information should be better secured.
	
	\item Cloud vendor abstraction on web application
	
	One challenge of the project was the difference between cloud vendors. Due to the time constraint, the developed web application is tied down to amazon web services only. It would be ideal if HemeWeb could work on any cloud vendors with minimal changes. This is going to be more of a reconciling the difference between cloud vendors and make an abstraction layers that HemeWeb will need to call whenever it needs to interact with the cloud vendors' feature.
    
    The project did achieve cloud vendor abstraction for the deployment scripts. The infrastructure can be deployed to three different cloud vendors easily. They are google cloud platform, amazon web service, and digital ocean. However, the web application needs more work to achieve the similar feat. Infrastructure can be deployed on these infrastructures, but HemeWeb still cannot work.
