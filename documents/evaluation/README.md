## Introduction

Hi there,

I, Steven, am writing dissertation for my MSc of Computer Science titled "HemeWeb: Blood flow simulation on the cloud". Today, I will be conducting an evaluation on my project to measure the usability of the project compared with the original approach to run blood flow simulations using HemeLB.

In this evaluation, I will need your help to run two different approach to run same blood flow simulation, followed by a short interview to measure your experience. These sessions will be recorded for evaluation purpose. It is to be noted that there are no right or wrong in running this simulation, so you do not have to worry. If in any of the process, you become uncomfortable, we will stop the session and you are free to leave.

Once again, thank you for helping me with my work.


Steven


## About the blood flow simulation

In this evaluation, you will run a blood flow simulation using
tools named HemeLB. The software will take sets of input and run
simulation to produce specific outputs from it.


We will compare the usability aspect of the simulation process using two
different approach, using command line and using web interface. You will
be given instruction on how to do both approach.
