# **Plan for HemelWeb (Tentative)**

---
## Important Dates
1. **15th April 2016**, Due date of Informatics Research Proposal
2. **31st March 2016**, Due date of AWS research grant


## Plan of Attack
From the discussion on 24th February 2016, basically we agreed that there are 3 possible approach for this project:

#### A) HemelB core on the cloud, setup on desktop
* **Succes criteria**: Web interface for the HemelB core take input of STL and profile file from the setup process on desktop and produce the simulation result correctly for download on the web
* **What I don't know**: 

#### B) The whole Blood Simulation running as a web service
* **Success criteria**: The whole simulation workflow is done via web browser:
1. Scientists / Doctors upload the blood vessel microscopic image to the web interface
2. Web server build the blood vessels' 3d model from the uploaded image (utilizing a cluster of AWS GPU instances)
3. Scientists / Doctors got an email that tells them that their blood vessel model is ready
4. 

#### C) Stream the whole simulation from AWS GPU instance



## Outstanding issues 

### A) Intellectual Property issues with Indonesian Government
